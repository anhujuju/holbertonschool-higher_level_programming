# 0x0F Python - Object-relational mapping :snake:

> Object-relational mapping is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. This project covers relational mapping along SQL with Python.

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:
  
* How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
* How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* What ORM means
* How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa
1. Script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa
2. Script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.
3. Script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument. But this time, write one that is safe from MySQL injections!
4. Script that lists all cities from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa
5. Script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state, using the database hbtn_0e_4_usa
6. Python file that contains the class definition of a State and an instance Base = declarative_base()
7. Script that lists all State objects from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
8. Script that prints the first State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
9. Script that lists all State objects that contain the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
10. Script that prints the State object with the name passed as argument from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
11. Script that adds the State object “Louisiana” to the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
12. Script that changes the name of a State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
13. Script that deletes all State objects with a name containing the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
14. Python file similar to model_state.py named model_city.py that contains the class definition of a City.
15. Files model_city.py and model_state.py, and save them as relationship_city.py and relationship_state.py.
16. Script that lists all State objects, and corresponding City objects, contained in the database hbtn_0e_101_usa
17. Script that lists all City objects from the database hbtn_0e_101_usa
